# Entrainment_Paradigm_Analysis

This repo contains the code used for the Analyisis of the results presented in the paper: 

"Coordination tending towards an anti-phase relationship determines greater sway reduction during entrainment with a   simulated  partner.'; Youssef Michel, Katrin Schulleri, Leif Johanssen and Dongheui Lee Human Movement Science 2023 " 

The file 'Analysis_entrainment.m" is the main script used for Data Analysis 
The folder "Utility_functions" contains some helper function Used in the main Script 

# Simulink Model 

The folder `SimulinkModel` containts the simulink Model, while the script "Param_IP.m" containts the paramters used in the model, and therefore, it should be executed before running the model
